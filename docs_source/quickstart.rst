Posts
  Posts are the bread and butter of an Engineer site. Posts are written in
  Markdown with a little YAML-formatted metadata, then are transformed into
  individual pages in a site, and also rolled up into list pages.
Templates
  Templates are how the content you write (typically as Posts) get
  transformed into a site. Engineer uses Jinja 2 as its templating engine. In
  general you don't have to mess with custom templates aside from specific
  templates used by a given theme.
Themes
  Themes are collections of templates, CSS (or LESS) styles, JavaScript,
  etc. that dictate the basic look and feel of your site. You can create your
   own themes or use some of the ones that are provided.
List Pages
  List pages are simply roll-up pages of posts. Think of the front page of a
  blog.
