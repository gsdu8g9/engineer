At its core, engineer is a static website generator. In other words,
engineer let's you build a website from a bunch of files - articles written
in Markdown, templates, and other stuff - and outputs *another* bunch
of files - HTML, mostly - that you can then copy wherever you want.

But engineer has some pretty nifty features that you might find
enticing. You can read more about the project at
